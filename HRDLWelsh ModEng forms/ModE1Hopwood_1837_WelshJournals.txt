Burying a Sexton Alive.
A Chelmsford newspaper gives the following remarkable story: -On Monday morning last, as Samuel Barker, the sexton and grave-digger at Dedham, was close to finishing digging a ten-foot deep grave, the earth suddenly fell in on both sides, and buried him completely. The lamentable accident was first discovered by a man called Hitchcock who was going through the graveyard on his way home fro his breakfast, and out of respect he turned to look at the grave that was being dug there; he then realised that the earth had fallen in, as explained previously, and after a short while he heard a groan as if it were coming from afar, and shortly after another. He immediately thought that the groan could be coming from the grave and that the sexton had been buried there, and he yelled out: "[How] are you there?" and he was answered by another groan, which confirmed that the unfortunate event had taken place. He ran to the road without delay and sounded the alarm and within a few minutes a great number of local residents had assembled at the graveyard, and every effort was made to lift the earth from the grave; but they were around 20 minutes before getting the unfortunate sexton's body out. He was found half-still and completely dead; and it is no surprise that such an event caused no small stir through the whole neighbourhood. Barker was 45 years old and he left a wife and five children to mourn his unnatural fate.
