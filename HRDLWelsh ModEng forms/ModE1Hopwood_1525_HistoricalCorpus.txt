I have [a story] in writing about a knight who is strong save that he could not control his own body when it came to food and drink and any which delicacy he would fancy. And so, in the end, he died and was buried in a stone chest. And this man had a son who was a strong man and who would say the profundis for his father's soul every day. And one day he put on a feast for all the men of stature in the land from all around him. And when water was brought him, he remembered to say the profundis and to say a prayer for his father's soul and he requested everyone to stay and they said they would go with him. And he then wished to see his father's grave opened and unless he checked that he would be dead in his own mind. And he made his servants open the grave and he saw in the grave a creature [lit. toad] as black as the blackest thing on earth and its eyes were two wheels underneath. And it had its claws around his father's heart and eating his heart as hastily as he could. And the son said unto it: 'Oh father, so much food and drink did you consume to your heart's content. And now I see the devil's hounds gorging on your heart, that which seems immense.' And then he took the stone chest upon him. And when he was to serve his people, he hid himself away and left his worldly glory and everything else of his life and he went to Jerusalem. And there he spent the rest of his life, serving the poor and the sick and those in poverty for as long as he lived. And when God saw it time for him to die, the angels took his soul to the [place of] everlasting joy.
