THE BURIAL LAW IN WALES. RECTOR OF LLANFROTHEN CLOSES ENTRANCE TO THE CEMETERY. - OPENED BY FORCE
There has been ill feeling for some time between the rector of Llanfrothen, in Meirionethshire, and his parishioners, and this because of his refusal to bury a Nonconformist in thew new cemetery that is connected to the old, under the new burial law. On Wednesday, Robert Roberts, Ty'rcapel, Llanfrothen died, after making it known a little before this that he would like to be buried with his daughter in the new cemetery, and following the provisions of the new Burial Law. An appeal was made to the rector for a grave in the usual manner, and this was granted. The next day, the deceased's brother went to the Rectory with the warning demanded by the Law, where there is no need for a rector's service. The reverend refused to accept this, but he let him into the house nonetheless. The grave was sealed according to the rector's instructions, and the sexton was warned not to reopen it. The entrance was locked too. After that, the grave digger told the rector that the deceased's relatives had asked him to prepare the grave once again, and since he was a public servant, he could not refuse. Mr. Jones warned that if the grave was opened, then the person responsible must face the consequences. Regardless, the grave was reopened and was prepared to receive the deceased man's remains. Mr Morris Roberts, Gareg, the rector, saw this on the morning of the day in question, and he went over things with him, but he did not grant permission for the deceased to be buried in the cemetery, and the bier was not available on that day either. Two or three men approached the entrance before the burial, and the entrance was opened with an iron bar, and [the funeral] was administered by the Rev. Thomas E. Roberts, M.A., the minister at Llanfrothen Chapel. This event caused ill feeling throughout the neighbourhood.
