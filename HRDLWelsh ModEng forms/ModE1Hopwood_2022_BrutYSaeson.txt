And after having been seventy years in the ground [Aelweyn/Dunstan?], a certain abbot moved the stone from on top of the grave. As he was placing a body inside the new grave that he had made for it, he found the body to be as healthy as when it was put in the ground. And when he found that there was no room in the grave, he divided the body into its members and in that place an abundance of blood came pouring out. And the abbot fell in a fit and hit his neck, and his soul left him. In time, the light of the saints shone until it seemed to the tillers and farmers that they were shining stars.
