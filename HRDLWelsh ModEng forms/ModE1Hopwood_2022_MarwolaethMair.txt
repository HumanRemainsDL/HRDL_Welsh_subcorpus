And after the Lord had said this, she [Mary] began to decline [in health] on her bed and gave thanks to the Lord for taking her spirit. And the apostles saw her spirit to be so bright that no mortal man could express its beauty. It was more beautiful than any snow nor metal nor silver nor gold shining with great clarity. And then the Lord committed Mary's soul to Mihangel [Michael] the Archangel who was guardian of paradise and prince of the Hebrew people. And then the Lord said unto the apostles: 'Keep Mary's body and take it southwards to city in the east. There we will have a new cemetery where no person was buried before. And after you have buried her, wait until I come to you in three days' time.' And after saying this, the Lord took his mother's soul with his holy angels in great splendour to heaven. And the angels went with great joy singing the Lord's praises. This is what the three virgins who were there did: they took the body to wash it with the ceremony that would take it to its death. And when they began to undress it, suddenly, it shone with great clarity such that no one could look at it so long as they could bestir themselves as they paid homage to the holiest body.
