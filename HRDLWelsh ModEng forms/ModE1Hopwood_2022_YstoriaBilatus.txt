And then the emperor [Tiberius] bid that he [Pilate] be put in prison until a judgement was made by the wise men regarding what death he should have. And the decision was to disgrace Pilate with the worst death possible. And when Pilate heard this he killed himself with his knife and from this death
he came to his end. And when the emperor heard this, he ordered that he be given the worst death as was decided for him. And so he was tied to an emormous weight and this was thrown to the river Tiber. And then the devil delighted in this unclean body. Then, the dirty corpse began to leak and cause the sea and the water to surge and caused storms and thunder and lightning and hail in the sky so that it was awful to everyone who heard it. And with that, the men of Rome pulled the body from the River Tiber and in order to mock it they took it to Vygena [Vienne] and threw it there over the top into the river Rodro [Rhone] which is the alternative road to hell, because it was a cursed river. And devils dwelt there always. And the people there could not bear the devils' restlessness upon the body. They also expelled the cursed vessel and took him to the ends of Losan [Lausanne] to bury him. And after some had been overcome by restlessness, they were taken from there away from them and thrown into a pit that was inside a mountain that was in the place where it is said that devilish soil still bubbles. And that is how  Pilate came to an end.
