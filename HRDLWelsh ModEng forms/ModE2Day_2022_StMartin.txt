After that, when Martin was going on a journey he saw in the distance, coming towards him, the body of a pagan being taken for burial. And he did not know what they were because they were so far from him, but when he saw the cloths [?fluttering] from the bier he supposed them to be peasants worshipping the false gods, because the custom of the French at that time was to go all around the fields carrying the images of demons wrapped in linen sheets. And then Martin made the sign of the cross with his hand between them and himself, and ordered them to put down the burden and not to move from that spot. And then stand still they did. First, like rocks, they stood motionless, then they tried by every means to walk but could not do it, turning instead like a wheel in the same place until they were compelled to put the body down. And they were greatly amazed, marvelling and wondering silently in their own minds what had happened to them. And when the blessed Martin realized that they were taking a body for burial, he gave them leave to continue on with the body to bury it.
