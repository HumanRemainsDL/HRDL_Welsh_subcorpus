And after the cursed happenings which were related above happened and many thousands of the pagans plundered the entire island with him [gotmá»½nt brenhin yr affric; 'Gormund, king of the Africans'], he [Gormund] gave most of the island to the Saxons, that [part] which is called Lloegyr [England], because through their betrayal he came to this island. And then the Britons withdrew to the westerly parts of the island namely Kymru [Wales] and Kernyw [Cornwall] and from there they wreaked many wars upon their enemies. And when Theon, archbishop of London and the archbishop of York, saw all the churches that were under their rule having been destroyed to the ground and the amount of ordained men who had fled because such was the danger, they escaped to the safety of the woods of Wales with the relics and the bones of saints with them. In case the pagans of a foreign language would destroy the relics that they had with them [and] that they had given to martyrdom in that sudden danger.
