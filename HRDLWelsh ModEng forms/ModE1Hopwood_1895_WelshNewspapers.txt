CHILDREN'S BODIES FOUND IN A GARDEN
An inquest was held in Newbridge, Monmouthshire, on Tuesday night, into the bodies of four babies that were found in buried in a garden in Morgan terrace, Newbridge. Ebenezer Morgan, an old man, who used to live in the house next to the garden in question, and who was a grave digger in Capel Beulah cemetery, said that he has buried scores of stillborn babies' bodies in the garden. After that, he would dig graves in the chapel cemetery, and move the bodies there. He must have forgotten to move the bodies that were found in the garden, the ones discovered by the present tenants. The most recent body was buried there three years ago. The doctors were unable to say whether these children had had a peculiar life or not. The verdict given was "they were found dead". Morgan was punished, and the matter has been made known to the Government authorities.
