37R. Three Fortunate Concealments of the Island of Britain
The Head of Bendigeidfran, son of Llŷr, which was concealed in the White Hill in London, with its face towards France. And as long as it was in the position in which it was put there, no Saxon Oppression would ever come to this Island;
The second Fortunate Concealment: the Dragons in Dinas Emrys, which Lludd son of Beli concealed;
And the third: the Bones of Gwerthefyr the Blessed, in the Chief Ports of this Island. And as long as they remained in that concealment, no Saxon Oppression would ever come to this Island.
And they were the Three Unfortunate Disclosures when they were disclosed. And Gwrtheyrn the Thin disclosed the bones of Gwerthefyr the Blessed for the love of a woman; that was Rhonwen the pagan woman;
And he disclosed the Dragons;
And Arthur disclosed the Head of Bendigeidfran (Brân the Blessed) from the White Hill, because it did not seem right to him that this Island should be defended by the strength of anyone, but by his own.
