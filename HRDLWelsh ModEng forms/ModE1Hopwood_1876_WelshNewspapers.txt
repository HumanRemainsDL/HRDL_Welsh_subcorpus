THE IRISHMAN TREMBLE EXHUMED
THE LATE J. JOHNES, ESQ, OF DOLAUCOTHY'S MURDERER

November 22nd, the body of this wretch was exhumed, and he was moved from Caio cemetery to a solo graveyard near Epynt mountain. The general feeling of Caio's parishioners was deeply hurt from seeing the murderer's body laying in the same cemetery as the deathly remains of the respected gentleman who was murdered by him, and so a great effort was made to have him removed from their parish cemetery.
