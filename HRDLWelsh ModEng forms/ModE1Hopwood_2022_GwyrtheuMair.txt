A scholar was in the city of Carnotwm [Chartres], light of temper and externally his body's wish was to be devoted. This man was already greeting the holy mother of God of the angelic greeting. And after he had been killed by his enemies, so the sad story goes, it was decided that he should not be buried in consecrated land. And after he had been buried outside consecrated land and he had been there for thirty years, the blessed virgin appeared to some [other] scholar and said unto him: 'why,' said she, have you put my chancellor outside the consecrated area. By my altar he would greet me devoutly. And with that, go swiftly and take his body to the cemetary.' And when he [sic.] declared this, everyone was in great awe of this. And when the grave was opened again, the finest little flower was found in his mouth and his tongue, complete and healthy as if he was ready to praise God. And with that, everyone understood that he had been praising the blessed virgin with his mouth. And after his body had been moved from there they took it to the cemetary and they buried it fittingly with rites.
