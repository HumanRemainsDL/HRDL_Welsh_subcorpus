1,220 years was Christ's age when St Thomas's body – archbishop of Canterbury – was lifted up by Ystyuyn Longetur [Stephen Langton] archbishop of the same place and the chief [archbishop] in all of England and a cardinal in Rome and he put it honourably in a noble tomb and took it – once it had been expertly crafted of gold and silver and adorned with various types of precious stones and gems, – to the church of the trinity, and through the majesty of service and the devotion of all the kingdom's scholars and many people, it was lowered.
