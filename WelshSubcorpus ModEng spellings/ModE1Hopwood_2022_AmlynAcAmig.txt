And after they came, St Albin, the bishop of Assw [Anjou], the man who God endowed with his saintliness and various talents, advised the king [Charlemagne] and queen to bury their knights [Amlyn and Amig] who were killed for the love of God as was their obligation and in order to bestow dignity and honour upon their bodies. And that advice was joyful with the king. And so two churches were made: one ordered by Chyarlys [Charles; Charlemagne], which was consecrated in honour of St Euseb [Eusebius] the Confessor, and the other was ordered by the queen, which was consecrated in honour of Peter the apostle. And then two tombs were sent for from Melan [Milan], where the finest tombs in the world were [found], in order to place the bodies of Amlyn and Amig inside. And in one of these Amlyn was buried in the church that was dedicated to Peter. And in the other Amig's body was buried and it was dedicated to St. Eusebius. And the other knights were buried according to their privileges and their rank in those churches with great honour. And when morning broke the following day, God had transferred Amlyn's body from the tomb and put it in the tomb with Amig's body in the church of Eusebius in the same tomb. And though the two bodies were in the same tomb, it was no more narrow to the two of them than it was for Amig's body on its own before then. And then everyone saw clearly that God was showing that the the souls were inseparable in heaven because he did not want to separate their bodies in this world here.
