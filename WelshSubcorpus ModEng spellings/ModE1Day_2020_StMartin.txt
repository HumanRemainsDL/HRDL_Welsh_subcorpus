Now we shall speak of Martinâ€™s virtues after he became bishop. There was, near the monastery there, a place that people used to revere, believing that martyrs had been buried there. And the high bishop had consecrated an altar there. And Martin came there and asked the foremost among the priests and clerics who were there what were the names of those martyrs and when had they suffered. And because he did not get any answer that satisfied him, he went away and did not come there for a while afterwards. Even so, he was troubled that he could not discover any certainty about the above-mentioned place, and that the people were at risk of harbouring a false faith. And then Martin and a few companions came to that place, and he stood on the grave and prayed to God to show him who had been buried there. And immediately he saw at his left-hand side, close by, a foul, cruel shade. And Martin asked him what was his name and his reward from God. And he said that he was a thief, and had been killed for his wickedness, and had no allotted portion with the martyrs. And everyone who was there heard him speaking, though they did not see him. And then Martin told everyone what he had seen, and caused the altar to be moved from that place and freed the people from their foolish belief.
