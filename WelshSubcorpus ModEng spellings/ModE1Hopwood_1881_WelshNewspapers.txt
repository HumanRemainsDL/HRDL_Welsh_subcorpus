EARL'S BODY STOLEN FROM HIS GRAVE
The general notion among men is that, when they descend to the grave, they will be left alone by theives and everyone else; but that was not how it was in Dunecht House, Aberdeenshire, for the body of the late Earl Crawford and Balcarres, for the vault next to the palace was broken into and three coffins were opened, and the body taken away. This took place on Tuesday night, last week, and because it was stormy at the time, it was favourable to the criminals. The above mentioned earl died in Florence last December, and his body was embalmed by skilful Italians in an artful manner. The body was stolen by the thieves, but it is astounding to report that they did not steal the silver decorations from the coffins. The police are doing every possible investigation within their power.
