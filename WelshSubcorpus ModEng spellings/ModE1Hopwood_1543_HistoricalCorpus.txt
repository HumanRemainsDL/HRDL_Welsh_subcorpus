The Island's Marvels

There are many marvels on the island of Britain, though four of them are superior to the rest.

The
first is a Hole in the ground called the pec [Peckham?] and the English call it the Devil's Arse of the Pek, and from there such a strong wind comes forth as able to blow out heavy hats that might be thrown in.

Second is the Giant's Circle [Stonehenge] on [?an amber] mountain near Caradog's Fort, which is today called Salisbury in the place where the British princes were buried, killed by Hengest's deceit and treachery, the wicked Saxon prince, where there are immense stones of great size set in the shape of doors, each on top of another: and no one knows for certain how they were set there

Third is a cave called shred hol [Cherdhole; Cheddar?] and other caves where men often entered and saw buildings and rivers and despite that, no one can reach its end

Fourth is to see the rain rising from the mountains, between them and the sky and immediately falling onto the fields

There is also in the north of the island of Britain where Arthur triumphed over the Picts and the Scots a lake called Llymonwy Lake [Lomond?] and in it there were 40 islands and sixty rivers coming from Britain's rivers to the lake and there is only one running to the sea and Llefyn is its name and in each of the islands there is a large stone upon high and in each stone there is an eagle's nest. And when those eagles all came to screech upon one stone it was certain to the men of the country that oppression would fall upon it [the country].
