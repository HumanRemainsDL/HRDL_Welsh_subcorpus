Discipulus: Are the faithful who have not been buried in the consecrated area bad? Magister: No. All of the world is a temple to God because it was consecrated by Christ's blood and so whatever is done, whether they are thrown in a field or in the woods or in an alder grove or somewhere else, they will not be devoured by beasts or animals because they will always be in the lap of the church's sanctuary, that which lies over the surface of the entire world. Discipulus: Is it good to be buried in a consecrated place? Magister: many places are consecrated by the people who are buried there. Discipulus: Is it beneficial to constantly worry about being buried in a consecrated place? [??] Magister: by praying for them from God's church and by the prayers of their families and companions. And above them in the churches and in the cemeteries. Discipulus: Is it good for evil people to be buried in consecrated places? Magister: it is worse for them to be pressed in burial with those that deserve to be separated far away from them and he who is read [about] should be buried by several demons of the same kind and should be cast far away from the consecrated place.
