And then, after proclaiming the death of the king [Uther Pendragon], the archbishops and bishops
and the abbots and the teachers and the scholars from all over the kingdom assembled. And from there, they took the king's body honourably to the monastery of Ambri [Ambrius]. And there, inside the Giants' Circle [Stonehenge] next to Emreis [Aurelius Ambrosius], his brother, he was buried 
with royal rites.
