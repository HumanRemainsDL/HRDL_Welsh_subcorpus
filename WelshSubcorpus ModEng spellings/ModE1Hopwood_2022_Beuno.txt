And in that time a labourer from Aberffraw came to the court of Ynyr Gwent. And nowhere in the world
was there a finer young lad than he. And when the daughter of Ynyr Gwent saw that young lad she loved him so much that she did not want to be without him. And the king recognised this then and heard her. And he decided  to give his daughter to this man in marriage before she was taken by someone of some other sort; he was certain that, because of the lad's fairness and gentleness, he was a son of a king and a noble. And after some time, the young lad returned, and his wife with him, to his country.
And they came to the place called Pennardd in Arfon. And then they dismounted their horses and rested
there. And from great tiredness and fatigue, he fell asleep on the queen. This is what he did when the queen fell asleep, he began to feel great guilt in his mind for going towards his country with so noble a wife as her though there was nowhere to take her and that he would have to return to work where he used to earn his keep. And so, from the devil's encouragement, with his sword, and with her asleep, he cut off her head. And took himself off away to his country with the good horses and the gold and the silver with him to the king. And with those goods he bought possessions and an office from the king, namely to be his distain [chief steward]. Beuno's shepherd then discovered the body and swiftly went to tell this to Beuno. This is what Beuno did next: he went with him full of spirit to the place where the body was. And in that place, he took the head and pressed it to the body and fell to his knees and prayed to God like so: 'Lord Creator of heaven and hearth, he who is ignorant of nothing, lift thee this body to full health'. And in this place, the virgin rose up in full health a relayed the full happenings to Beuno.
