A PRIEST IS BURIED FOUR TIMES.
Y widow by the name of Jones, who has recently left Canterbury, has greatly distinguished herself by taking to carrying her husband's dead body around with her. Mr. Jones, who was a priest in Portsmouth, died around two years ago, and he was buried there. But within a short while, his widow moved to Highgate; and having been granted permission by the Home Secretary, she moved her husband's body from his grave in Canterbury and reburied it in Highgate cemetery. Around eighteen months ago, Mrs. Jones went to lodge in Canterbury, and she dug up her husband's body a second time, and buried him near to where she was living. She decided to move once again, and her husband's remains were again moved, this time to Liverpool, where the lady had gone to live. Every time the body was moved, the remains were put in a new coffin, so that by the move to Liverpool, there were four coffins involved. It is said that each exhumation and reburial cost around 30p., and so the whole thing cost 120p.
